        <h2>let's build something amazing!!</h2>
        <p>
          It's nice to meet you! My name's Andrew Robbins and I'm an independent
          Web Developer who enjoys helping agencies and companies build
          beautiful web experiences. I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic
          Design and 5+ years of working with the web including many hours spent
          <a href="#">here</a> and <a href="#">here</a>. I currently live in
          Minneapolis, MN and work out of the <a href="#">CoCo</a>in Uptown.<br/><br />
          I consider myself an expert problem solver that blends complexity with
          simple and elegant solutions. I specialize in <span>JavaScript</span
          ><span>CSS </span><span>HTML</span>and <span>Wordpress</span>. I love building
          responsive sites and working with JavaScript frameworks like Angular
          JS. Making the web beautiful is what I do bestâ€”let's build something
          amazing.
